## Introduction
<p align="justify">
This project presents a smart door lock system based on facial recognition. It uses MTCNN for face detection and InceptionResNetV1 for feature embedding. A custom anti-spoofing model named DualInputCNN enhances security by verifying face authenticity using both RGB and LBP image inputs.
</p>

## Features
- Real-time face detection and recognition
- Anti-spoofing to prevent fake face attacks
- Threshold-based Euclidean distance for identity verification
- Servo motor control for lock/unlock mechanism
- Integrated with Raspberry Pi and webcam
- Remote access via Flask API hosted on Google Colab

## Installation
- Clone this repository
- Download the DualInputCNN model from this repo: [AlvinOctaH/DualInputCNN](https://huggingface.co/AlvinOctaH/DualInputCNN)
- Mount your Google Drive in Colab
- Run colab_face_recognition.ipynb to start the Flask server
- Connect Raspberry Pi to the internet and run:
  - raspberry_pi_register_face.py to register users
  - raspberry_pi_face_recognition.py to perform recognition and unlock the door

## Usage
- Register face images via the Raspberry Pi script
- When a user is in front of the camera, the system:
  - Detects the face using MTCNN
  - Verifies liveness using anti-spoofing model
  - Extracts facial features with InceptionResNetV1
  - Compares against stored embeddings using Euclidean distance
  - Unlocks door via servo motor if identity is verified

## System Design
The system consists of hardware and software components designed to operate together through REST API communication. The lock mechanism is driven by an SG90 servo motor, controlled by a Raspberry Pi, and integrated with a webcam to capture facial images.
- The physical design includes a 3D-printed prototype
- All wiring and layout are integrated into a compact and functional housing

## Model Architecture
- Anti-Spoofing: DualInputCNN model with RGB and LBP image branches
- Face Recognition: InceptionResNetV1 pretrained on VGGFace2
- Uses Euclidean distance to compare embeddings with a defined threshold (e.g., 0.7)

## Dataset
- Anti-spoofing: nguyenkhoa/antispoofing-3 (using only 10.000 data)
- Custom webcam images for finetuning anti-spoofing (190 data)
- Face recognition images registered manually via Raspberry Pi

## Results and Evaluation
- Face Detection: yields F1-score = 1.0
- Face Recognition: Best threshold at 0.7 yields F1-score = 0.964
- Anti-Spoofing Accuracy: 77,8% using "nguyenkhoa/antispoofing-3" dataset
- Security: FAR = 0%, FRR = 6.7%
- Performance: Average system response time â‰ˆ 9.26 seconds

## Future Work
- Integrate Vision Transformer (ViT) with DINO pretraining for better spoofing resistance
- Add channel attention mechanism to enhance anti-spoofing
- Apply quantization and pruning for efficient edge deployment
